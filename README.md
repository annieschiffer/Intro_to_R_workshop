## Intro to R Workshop

This workshop is part of the USU Ecology Center Data Science workshop series. In this workshop, we introduce R, open a project in R, discuss reproducible script and file organization, and cover basic elements of RStudio. This workshop is intended for folks who have never opened R before or want a refresher on starting a project in R.

The script is typically emailed to workshop participants before the workshop. Participants create their own R project, follow along in the script, and complete the exercises to practice writing basic R code.
